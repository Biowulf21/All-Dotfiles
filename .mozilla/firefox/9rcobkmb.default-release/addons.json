We have extensive filters that filter against annoying display and video ads (including YouTube).\n\nUnlike other ad blockers, we do not have “acceptable ads” or an advertiser whitelist (i.e. certain advertisers pay to bypass ad filters).

Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

This native app is available for Mac, Linux and Windows (Download link: https://ui.vision/rpa/x/download). The native app is required to take desktop screenshots. But you only need to install this app _if_ you want to pick colors from desktop apps or Chrome special pages! For the regular web page color picking, installing the helper app is not required.\n\nFeedback and bug reports:\n\nColorFish is still in beta, if you're having issues or found a bug, please don't post you bug report here, contact us directly so we can fix it: https://ui.vision/contact","weeklyDownloads":151,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"UI Vision RPA Software","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13041438/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/235/235803.png?modified=1622135276","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/235/235803.jpg?modified=1622135276","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"The open-source color picker can select colors from all websites, images, movies and even from your desktop."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3,"reviewCount":7,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/colorfish-color-picker/reviews/","updateDate":1579731313000},{"id":"anti-social@conniptions.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/991/991688-32.png?modified=55717860","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/991/991688-64.png?modified=55717860","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/991/991688-128.png?modified=55717860"},"name":"anti-social","version":"0.7.8","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1130178/anti_social_blocker-0.7.8.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/wgmyers/anti-social/issues","description":"An extension aimed at increasing human happiness by blocking social media sites.","fullDescription":"anti-social features:\n\n    You can block specific pages, directories, or whole domains.\n    You can control when the blocker operates both with a weekly schedule and with a snooze button.\n    The weekly schedule indicates which days anti-social should block sites: eg, only block Monday to Friday.\n    On days when blocking is on, you can set an automatic window when blocking is temporarily turned off: eg, don't block at lunchtime.\n    If you don't want an automatic window, you can set the length of it to zero, and there won't be one.\n    You can turn blocking off with a 'snooze' button in the popup menu, but it comes back on again after five minutes.\n    If you use the 'snooze' button, you can't use it again for the next hour.\n    You can change these default snooze timeouts; snooze can be up to 30 minutes, snooze timeout up to six hours.\n    If you set the snooze timeout to zero, you can snooze as often as you like: use of this option is between you and your conscience.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis add-on does not phone home and never will. It does not collect any information about you or the websites that you visit, except for the list of websites that you choose to block.
